"""
Interactive wizard: build a story.config.json by describing a customer journey.

Run it, answer a few questions, and it writes a ready-to-generate config:

    python scripts/new_story.py

It first asks whether you're making a PROPOSAL (win a client — the Matt Knights
pattern) or a BLOG / landing page (show off a product — the honey-site pattern),
then walks you through a 4-scene journey. It bakes in the two cinematic rules for
you automatically: every camera move drifts upward (so the four scenes feel like
one continuous ascent) and the scenes brighten as they rise.

Output: story.config.json at the repo root (or --out PATH). Then:
    python scripts/generate_images.py   # 4 keyframes
    python scripts/generate_video.py    # 4 clips -> ascent.mp4
    python scripts/build.py             # -> dist/
